## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a chapter where Alexander discovers a plant he thought extinct, being tended in secret by a villager.
- Create a journal entry from the perspective of the new Laird, explaining his 'improvements' to a friend in London.
- Write a letter from Alexander to a fellow naturalist in the Cape, describing the 'ecological poverty' of the managed estate.
- Draft a folk tale told by Mrs. MacLeod about a spirit that lives in the lichen, recording all it has witnessed.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of Sgeir Mhòr/Askir that layers Alexander's scientific observations over historical settlement maps and Gaelic place names.
- Create a generative art piece that uses the novel's text to 'grow' two contrasting floral patterns: one orderly and Latin, one wild and intertwined with Gaelic phrases.
